Rising real estate costs have made many people consider living in rented housing rather than opting for home ownership. The rental housing sector in the United States is one of the major real estate markets, housing around one-fourth of the population. However, this market has been understudied due to its informal traits, and historically minimal data availability. Housing rental prices depend on many factors such as location, and property-specific facilities. This project examines Craigslist rental listings data that was publicly available on Kaggle. 

Data from Craigslist offers various variables that affect housing rental prices and is more updated than the typical sources of housing rental data from censuses done every five years, or other commercial databases. The data that Craigslist offers is hence understudied even though it consists of data from all over the United States with more recent market activity. This knowledge gap in rental housing markets was aimed to be bridged. 

The data was cleaned, analysed, and visualised for this purpose using Python. How much the square footage of the housing is, the region in which the housing is located, how many bathrooms the housing has, what the laundry option is, and what parking option is available were found to be the most significant indicators of housing rental prices. Further, several regression machine learning models were tested to make predictions of housing rental prices. Random Forest regressor performed the best in predicting the housing rental prices as it had the lowest Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error and the highest R-squared value of 0.73 and cross-validation score.
